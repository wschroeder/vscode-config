# Cursor Setup

This is probably the same setup approach as for VS Code.

1. Before installing Cursor IDE, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/wschroeder/vscode-config /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Cursor
```

2. Install Cursor IDE.

3. Open Cursor IDE, and install these plugins:

   * Vim by vscodevim
   * Nix Environment Selector by arrterian
   * ESLint by dbaeumer
   * ElixirLS: Elixir support and debugger by JakeBecker

4. Profit!
